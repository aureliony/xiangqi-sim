# Autonomous Xiangqi-Playing Robot

![PyBullet Simulation](imgs/simulation.png)

## Overview

This project integrates robotics and AI to develop an autonomous system capable of playing **Xiangqi** (Chinese Chess). The robot system is based on a **6-DOF UR5e robotic arm** with a **Robotiq 2F-85 gripper** for precise manipulation of Xiangqi pieces.

The robot uses the **Pikafish** open-source Xiangqi engine to determine optimal moves. Our focus is on real-world applications in robotic game-playing, human-robot interaction and motion planning.

## Project Structure

![Project Structure](imgs/project_structure.png)

- **Robot Model**: A UR5e robotic arm with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper.
- **Game Engine**: Pikafish.
- **Motion Planning**: Simple Pick-and-Place, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).
- **Piece Classification**: PyBulletâ€™s 3D camera and segmentation mask, with image processing in OpenCV.
- **Chess Pieces and Board Design**: Modeled using Blender, with color-coded pieces for improved visibility in computer vision tasks.

## Installation

1. Create a new Anaconda environment: `conda create -n xiangqi python=3.10`

1. Activate the environment: `conda activate xiangqi`

1. Install pip dependencies: `pip install "numpy<2" opencv-python`

1. Install conda dependencies: `conda install conda-forge::pybullet`

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aureliony/CS4278-Project.git`

## Run the simulation

Run the simulation (Pikafish vs. Pikafish) with the command `python -m simulation.chess`.

### Additional parameters

`--humans <int>`: No. of humans in the game. Specify 0 for self-playing, 1 to play as red against Pikafish, and 2 to play against yourself or a friend.

`--level <int>`: Indicates the Pikafish difficulty/depth level, from 1 to 20.

`--mp_algo <str>`: Indicates the motion planning algorithm to use for arm/gripper movement. Supported values are `pnp` and `rrt`.

## Troubleshooting

If your CPU does not support AVX2 instructions, you may need to try a different build of Pikafish. Replace the `engine/pikafish.exe` executable as required.
